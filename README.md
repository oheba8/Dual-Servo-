Servo Motor Control Using Arduino Uno

Overview

This project controls two servo motors using an Arduino Uno board. The servos rotate from 0 degrees to 180 degrees and then return back to 0 degrees, with a short delay between each movement. The project demonstrates basic servo control using the Servo library.

Components
 • Arduino Uno board
 • 2 servo motors
 • Jumper wires
 • USB cable

Wiring
 • Servo 1 signal pin → Digital pin 7
 • Servo 2 signal pin → Digital pin 8
 • Both servos connected to 5V and GND on the Arduino

Code Logic
 • Servo 1 is attached to pin 7, and Servo 2 to pin 8
 • The angle increases from 0 to 180, then decreases back to 0
 • A delay of 15 milliseconds is used between movements
 • The code uses the Servo.h libraryServo Motor Control Using Arduino Uno
